# python-empty-times
It is a simple project which find out the empty cells of excel files in a special directory/folder
and base on their coordinates. After collecting the coordinates, it will generates a graph to show most empty cells.

## story of this project
I have a professor who asks students to fill out an excel file to find out empty days and times
of week, which almost students have and can join the class.
Students must fill out the excel file and send to the professor.
The professor can have the chart which shows the most acceptable times and days based on students class chart.
Of course he has this project done in Csharp.


### how to test and watch demo
1) Clone the project **https://github.com/rezalaki/python-empty-times.git**.
2) Run the file named **createExcels.py**.
	It will generate 5 excel files within random data in the **data_store** directory/folder.
3) Run the file **main.py** and waite until the graph appearses.


## How to get your own graph
1) Send the file **test_file.xlsx** to your students. 
**Don't forget to ask theme set their own Name and Last to avoid over-writing**.
2) Copy the **main.py** file where you like.
3) In the same directory/folder your **main.py** is located, create a directory/folder named **data_store**.
4) Copy all excel files of your students into **data_store** directory/folder.
5) Run the **main.py** file.
